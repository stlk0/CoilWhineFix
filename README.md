# CoilWhineFix

## Description
CoilWhineFix is a specialized application developed to address the issue of coil whine on AM5 ASUS B650 motherboards. Coil whine can be an annoyance for users of these motherboards, particularly when their PC is idle. This tool is designed to keep your GPU engaged with minimal load, thereby reducing the likelihood of coil whine occurring.

CoilWhineFix achieves this by generating a very light GPU load, such as executing a NOP (No Operation) operation or rendering a single pixel at regular intervals. Users have the flexibility to customize this behavior through the UI to match their specific preferences and needs.
